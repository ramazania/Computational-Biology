A description of any known bugs
    - I get an error that says maximum recursion depth reached when calling the hirschberg's algorithm recursively. I decided to remove the recursion to make the code work for now. 

The names of anyone you discussed the project with and any outside resources you consulted when writing the code.

    1. Professor Layla helped me understand how the algorithm works on a high level.
